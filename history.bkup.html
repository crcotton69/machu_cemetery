        <p>Pavel and Rozina (Trlica) Machu settled in Williamson County in 1878 and contributed to the agricultural development of the community. The cemetery began in 1883 when Machu helped a woman bury her husband who died during their journey. Machu offered to bury him on a two-acer section of the machu farm located about five miles southwest of Granger. The first recorded burial was that of Katrina Safarik in 1892. Burials include descendants of Pavel and Rozina, veterans and other citizens of the community. The cemetery was relocated to its current location in 1976 before the construction of the Laneport Dam. Members of the Machu family continue to maintain this historic cemetery.</p>
